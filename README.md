## Hi there 👋

<!--
**pboydit/pboydit** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on reviewing the new standards for AD and Domain Controllers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and my new IAM job functions.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Active Directory and IAM related.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anything that can aid me in my new job functions.
- 💬 Ask me about Active Directory and the services it provides.
- 📫 How to reach me: via email (phillip.boyd@bcbsnc.com) or via Teams
- ⚡ Fun fact: my first career was in Television production
